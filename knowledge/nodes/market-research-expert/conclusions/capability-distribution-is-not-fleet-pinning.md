title: Capability distribution does not establish fleet pinning or safe provenance
description: The 2026-11-02 investigation separates organization-wide capability distribution from content pinning and rollout evidence, without establishing a vendor-wide lockfile gap or measured copy-drift cost.

# Dated conclusion

Compare **distribution, version selection, content identity, review and
rollout to existing instances** separately. An organization-wide marketplace
or shared instruction repository does not by itself establish which content
a running agent received, whether it was reviewed, or whether every agent
received an update.

This is a **source-reported research conclusion as of 2026-11-02**, not an
audit of vendor contracts or a claim that OATS leads the market.

# What the investigation establishes and leaves open

The source reports organization-wide sharing mechanisms in Claude Code,
Cursor and GitHub, and contrasts ref/commit selection, latest-tracking rules
and registry versions [1]. Its GitHub default-branch interpretation is
explicitly an inference. The capture has no exact primary-page locators or
version-specific contracts sufficient to certify those install/update
semantics. The comparison axes survive; a definitive product feature matrix
does not.

The investigation did not identify a documented vendor fleet lockfile with
content hashes. This is a **bounded search result**, not proof that no vendor
has one: the capture lacks a reproducible survey inventory. It also supplies
no measured cost of copied-agent-configuration drift. Its Duolingo account
about repeated shell-script copies is an analogy from repository tooling,
not an agent-fleet effect estimate or proof that a particular template tool
solves agent rollout.

The note's public-registry security reports concern malicious or critically
risky skills, not controlled comparisons of pinned and unpinned fleets.
Their short summaries do not establish that lack of pinning caused the
reported harm or that pinning alone prevents it. A hash can identify a fixed
malicious input too; **content identity is not review or trust**. No registry
prevalence estimate or measured pinning benefit is promoted from this capture.

# Consequence for comparisons

Ask what is selected, what content is actually loaded, how its provenance is
reviewed and which existing instances change when a pin is updated. Require
evidence for those transitions rather than infer them from distribution
availability or semantic versioning. The research does not select a lock
format, prescribe an upgrade mechanism or certify an installation. If a
rollout invariant is adopted, enforcement and tests belong in the owning
implementation rather than a remembered warning about drift.

The [storage/maintenance comparison](/nodes/market-research-expert/conclusions/agent-knowledge-storage-2026.md)
owns the same investigation's layout and unchanged-configuration finding;
configuration edit frequency is not a measured stale-content rate. The
[approval-authority lesson](/nodes/market-research-expert/lessons/question-routing-is-not-approval-authority.md)
owns the existing distinction between agent and human approval; capability
distribution establishes neither.

**Owner:** market-research-expert. Recheck when version-specific primary
contracts document fleet content selection and rollout, or controlled studies
measure configuration divergence and review/pinning effects. Update or
supersede this dated finding and log the change. Do not retain the current
search gap as a permanent product limitation.

# Citations and evidence boundary

1. Claude Code marketplace documentation, Cursor team rules, GitHub shared
   instructions, the Agent Skills specification and MCP registry, as named
   by the source; exact pages/versions are not retained in the capture.
2. Duolingo, LDX3 June 2026 account, as described by the source; an analogy
   from repository tooling only, with no exact primary locator retained.
3. Koi and Snyk public-skill-registry reports, as named in the note; no exact
   report URLs, sampling methods or matched pinning comparison retained.

The harvest read only the captured proposal and named note. These broad
source attributions are not primary-page checks, reproduced security results
or a product-availability audit. No measured model result is established for
the distribution comparison.
