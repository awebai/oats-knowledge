title: Attribute multi-agent gains to tested mechanisms, not persona labels
description: The 2026-11-02 research synthesis does not isolate a causal benefit from job-title personas, so compare artifacts, feedback and authority separately from role names.

# Conclusion and scope

Do not use a successful role-based agent framework as evidence that its job
titles caused the improvement. The captured research distinguishes a persona
label from the artifact requirements, phase instructions, tools and feedback
that accompany it. Removing a whole role changes several of those at once;
that ablation cannot isolate the label's contribution.

This is a **source-reported research conclusion as of 2026-11-02**, not an
independent replication or a finding that personas never help. It concerns
accuracy and agent-task performance, not whether a role can guide tone or
make responsibilities legible to people. The complementary
[role-name lesson](/nodes/market-research-expert/lessons/role-names-carry-product-meanings.md)
separately treats product meanings, human interpretation and the reported
employee/tool oversight lead; these are not agent-task accuracy results.

# Evidence and its limits

The source reports that Zheng et al. (Findings of EMNLP 2024) and Wharton's
*Playing Pretend* (2025-12-05) found no reliable average accuracy benefit
from expert personas in the settings they tested. The latter is identified
as arXiv 2512.05858. These are not controlled long-running agentic studies
on every later model.

The source's reading of MetaGPT/ChatDev ablations is that role removal also
removes associated instructions or artifacts. It contrasts that confounding
with reported gains from executable feedback. This supports separating the
mechanisms, **not** concluding that artifacts or verifiers explain every
multi-agent gain. The source also reports that Anthropic's delegation
guidance of 2025-06-13 specifies objectives, output formats, tools and
boundaries rather than relying on an expert title alone.

No title-only ablation on long agentic tasks with 2026 models is established
by the captured evidence. That is an open question, not proof that no such
study exists. The proposal acknowledges that some older papers were not
re-fetched; the supplied note does not identify which. Numerical effects
and a universal zero-effect claim are therefore not retained here.

# Consequence for comparisons

When comparing OATS with provider-native agents, distinguish **reviewed
domain knowledge and authority** from a persona string. Ask which artifacts,
feedback channels and boundaries each design supplies, and whether an
experiment actually holds them constant. The accepted
[expert-domain roster](/nodes/oats-maintainer/decisions/domain-expert-rebuild.md)
and [durable-specialization rationale](/nodes/oats-maintainer/decisions/durable-specialization.md)
remain their own decisions; this research neither proves their performance
nor changes the roster. See also
[topology and compute controls](/nodes/market-research-expert/lessons/topology-gains-depend-on-task-and-budget.md).

**Owner and recheck:** market-research-expert. Recheck when a study isolates
persona wording while holding artifacts, tools, feedback and compute fixed
on agentic tasks with newer models. Correct or supersede this conclusion and
log the change when that evidence changes its scope.
