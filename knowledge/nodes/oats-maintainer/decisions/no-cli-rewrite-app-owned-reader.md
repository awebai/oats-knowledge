# Decision and acceptance

The source records Pepe's acceptance on 2026-10-29: do not rewrite the `oats`
CLI in Rust or another native language, either in full or as a partial
native fast path for hot reads. Improve Node startup first, then amortize
repeated reads in an **app-owned warm reader**. Acceptance is source-reported
in the proposal and named note, with a decision-comment locator below; this
harvest did not independently verify the conversation.

The selected direction is:

- **Node fixes:** use the compile cache and load only the leaves needed by
  hot reads. The kernel node owns the separate
  [cache-placement rationale](/nodes/oats-kernel-expert/decisions/compile-cache-stays-in-the-per-user-oats-home.md)
  and [import-boundary decision](/nodes/oats-kernel-expert/decisions/hot-read-imports-preserve-contracts-and-static-boundaries.md).
- **App-owned reader:** Desktop's bundled server and the TUI start a child
  from the kernel installation they already use. That process keeps the
  kernel's own read code warm and answers the CLI's JSON envelopes over
  stdin/stdout. It dies with the app and exits when the installation changes;
  the app falls back to the CLI. There is no system service, socket or
  separate user installation or acceptance step for the reader.

These are lifecycle and ownership constraints, not a deployment or release
receipt. The later agreement and reported implementation outcome are recorded
below. The app owns the process lifetime, not a second implementation of
deployment facts. This preserves the
[public process boundary](/nodes/oats-kernel-expert/decisions/minimal-process-boundary.md)
and [installed-kernel authority](/nodes/oats-desktop-expert/decisions/standalone-product-and-cli-authority.md),
rather than permitting private kernel imports into a client or a hidden
bundled operational kernel.

# Why this choice

The [kernel evaluation](/nodes/oats-kernel-expert/lessons/kernel-rewrite-does-not-remove-child-waits.md)
separates startup and module loading from provider, network and harness waits.
A language change does not remove unchanged external work. A kernel-only
rewrite would also leave the Node requirements of the capabilities and
clients in the evaluated system; it is not a Node-removal plan.

The source reports that the first Node fixes reduced `version` from about
195 to 59 ms and `session inspect` from about 223 to 93 ms. These are historical,
source-reported examples supporting the choice, not a cross-host performance
budget or a reproduced benchmark. The evaluation's roughly 3–5% spawn gain
from a rewrite was an estimate, not a measured equivalent native kernel.

The warm-reader comparison likewise informed the direction, not a performance
promise: the source quotes roughly 0.1 CPU seconds per Desktop tick for a warm
reader versus roughly 0.2 for starting a native binary per poll. Neither a
complete reader nor an equivalent native implementation was established by
that comparison. Keep the distinction between avoiding startup repeatedly
and making a newly started process cheaper; measure representative workloads
before claiming the delivered benefit.

# Rejected alternatives

- **Full or partial native rewrite:** adds per-platform builds and signing,
  plus duplicate maintenance of the most-read contract in the partial case,
  for startup savings the selected Node work aims to obtain without that
  distribution and contract cost.
- **System service with a socket:** adds installation, lifecycle management,
  discovery, socket permissions and stale-daemon risk after an update.
  App-owned lifetime was selected to obtain the warm-process benefit without
  that separate operational burden.
- **Desktop importing kernel code in-process:** breaks the client boundary
  and does not provide the TUI with the same benefit.
- **A maintainer agent as the reader:** replies cost seconds and tokens, the
  agent is restarted and compacted, and most hosts have no such agent. This
  responsibility belongs to an ordinary process, not an agent conversation.

# Reconsideration and contract boundary

Revisit a native rewrite only if **both** conditions remain: hot reads still
exceed roughly 150 ms after the Node fixes, **and** poll CPU remains a complaint
after the app-owned reader. That is a trigger to reconsider, not automatic
approval for a rewrite.

The reader's request/reply format, feature probe, version and fallback rules
are a public contract. The initial other-side response recorded no objection
to the **shape** and supplied review criteria, not agreement to the detailed
contract. Those
criteria were request-time deployment facts (warm code, not warm data, with
any cache and invalidation stated), CLI-equivalent envelopes/errors/unknowns,
and a probe/version rule matching the app's accepted CLI range, with remote
routes proposed out of the first cut.

## Contract agreement and accepted limits (2026-10-29)

The later captured proposal reports that **both product sides agreed the
contract before implementation** on the evaluation issue. This explicitly
supersedes the earlier pending-contract classification, not the no-rewrite
decision or the public process boundary. The other side attached three build
conditions:

1. Keep code warm, not deployment data: each request reads the deployment
   afresh, with intentional observation reuse bounded separately.
2. Require a CLI-versus-reader differential test with mutations and an
   installation-stamp check on every request.
3. Admit `status-liveness` only after the pane-rule fix.

The TUI deliberately uses the same child reader through the shared client,
not warm kernel calls in its own process: the client boundary forbids kernel
imports. It does not re-probe; after an installation change it stays on CLI
fallback for the remainder of that run. Preserve this accepted fallback cost
rather than treating it as a forgotten optimization.

The source reports that the conditions were met and the reader was built for
both Desktop and TUI. That is a dated reported outcome, not a claim about a
release or installation on any host. Changes to the agreed terms return to
both sides under the existing
[issue-recorded contract gate](/nodes/oats-maintainer/stewardship/review-protocol.md#contract-agreement-stays-on-the-issue-through-implementation-2026-10-28).
The source reports bilateral maintainer agreement; it does not establish a
new direct human acceptance of every protocol detail.

The [kernel lifetime lesson](/nodes/oats-kernel-expert/lessons/warm-process-state-needs-lifetime-classification.md)
owns the state-classification and installation-identity rationale. Keep
executable differential and install-change checks with the implementation,
not a second wire specification here. The subsequent
[display-only observation-reuse decision](/nodes/oats-maintainer/decisions/observation-reuse-never-authorizes.md)
owns the deliberate bounded staleness exception; keeping code warm does not
permit undeclared process-lifetime data caches.

## Reported follow-up measurement

The source attributes interleaved runs on one real deployment to the lead,
not to measurements repeated by the source or this harvest. It reports a
warm-reader tick falling from about 1 s wall / 700 ms CPU to about 250 ms
wall / 260 ms CPU once the login observation was reused, with GitHub calls
falling from roughly one per five seconds per Desktop to one per minute.
These are historical source-reported results, not cross-host budgets or a
native-versus-Node benchmark. They do not prove the earlier 0.1 CPU-second
expectation or remove the conjunctive reconsideration trigger.

The generalist's [profiling lesson](/nodes/oats-expert/lessons/profile-read-waits-before-designing-concurrency.md)
owns the attribution-before-concurrency conclusion and its separate stand-in
experiment; do not conflate that control with the reported reuse outcome.
The messaging node's [batched-query rationale](/nodes/oats-aweb-expert/decisions/readiness-cache-needs-measured-cost.md)
remains a separate publisher concern, not proof this reader serves it.

# Evidence

Evidence: OKF proposal from oats-maintainer/product-maintainer-pepe, 2026-10-29; notes/no-cli-rewrite-app-owned-reader.md; notes/hot-reads-stay-off-core.md.

The source identifies [awebai/oats#1630](https://github.com/awebai/oats/issues/1630)
as the kernel 0.69.4 evaluation and
[comment 6494974298](https://github.com/awebai/oats/issues/1630#issuecomment-6494974298)
as the original direction record. It identifies
[#1632](https://github.com/awebai/oats/pull/1632) and
[#1634](https://github.com/awebai/oats/pull/1634) as the Node fixes. These are
source-provided evidence locators, not independently audited acceptance,
merge, release or benchmark receipts from this harvest.

Checked by the knowledge maintainer at review on 2026-10-29: the decision
comment states the rejection of options D and E, the conjunctive
reconsideration trigger, the `version` and `session inspect` timings, the
app-owned shape and the ~0.1 CPU-second expectation; the issue body carries
the ~0.2 native-per-poll ceiling and the 3–5% spawn estimate; #1632 and
#1634 are merged. The other side's shape reply is
[comment 6494985666](https://github.com/awebai/oats/issues/1630#issuecomment-6494985666).
The rejection reasons for a system service, an in-process import and an agent
reader come from the source notes and were not checked against the issue.
That earlier review did not verify the later contract or reuse outcome.

Evidence for the later agreement and outcome: OKF proposal from oats-maintainer/product-maintainer-pepe, 2026-10-29; notes/no-cli-rewrite-app-owned-reader.md.

The updated source identifies the
[contract proposal](https://github.com/awebai/oats/issues/1630#issuecomment-6495394874)
and [other-side agreement with build conditions](https://github.com/awebai/oats/issues/1630#issuecomment-6495412442),
plus the [reuse proposal](https://github.com/awebai/oats/issues/1630#issuecomment-6500978620)
and [conditional agreement](https://github.com/awebai/oats/issues/1630#issuecomment-6501015544).
Agreement, completion and measurements in this refinement remain
source-reported; this harvest did not audit the implementation, rerun tests
or independently verify those later comments.
