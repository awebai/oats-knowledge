title: Healthy defaults do not warn merely because an optional feature is off
description: Readiness warnings identify a fault or actionable consequence of a chosen configuration, not an invitation to enable an intentionally optional feature, because permanent warnings on healthy defaults train operators to ignore real problems.

# Preserve the meaning of a warning

When reviewing readiness or doctor output, ask what the operator can repair
without adopting an optional feature they deliberately left off. A healthy
default deployment should not carry a permanent warning merely because that
feature is disabled. Put the feature's disabled state in its own status and
documentation instead.

This is a review judgment about signal, not a preference for fewer messages:
a warning that never clears under a supported, healthy configuration teaches
operators to ignore the warnings that do require action. A test change from
an empty warning list to a warning on an otherwise healthy default fixture
is a reason to challenge the new requirement, not simply update the fixture.

The boundary is **intentionally unused**, not **broken**. A missing
prerequisite, a fault in an enabled feature or a fallback from a selected
configuration can still deserve a warning. The integration node's
[defined-fallback lesson](/nodes/integrations-expert/lessons/a-fallback-the-contract-defines-is-a-warning-not-a-readiness-problem.md)
remains canonical for honoring and reporting a contract's fallback; this
lesson does not suppress those diagnostics or change a supported baseline.

# Prevention and limits

Enforce the chosen distinction in provider readiness tests: keep the healthy
feature-off case quiet and retain cases for actionable faults. The semantic
question belongs in the maintainer's existing direction/review gate; an
assertion cannot decide whether a feature ought to be required. No test or
skill change is delivered by this lesson.

Evidence: OKF proposal from oats-maintainer/release-maintainer-pepe,

The source reports applying this rule in
[awebai/oats-aweb#168](https://github.com/awebai/oats-aweb/pull/168), returning
`7ef6f814` and resolving the objection at `4baea42e`. That is source-reported
review evidence, not an independently audited implementation, test run or
release. No new human acceptance or change to an existing human decision
is claimed.
