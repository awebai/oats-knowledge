title: Record locks favor recoverable refusal over live-holder theft
description: Record-store lock age must not override a live local holder, with foreign-lock fallback and the check-unlink race remaining explicit limits.

# Rationale

Decided 2026-09-05 during the record-store lock review. The failure came from
comparing clocks with different starting events: a wait timeout starts when a
contender arrives; lock age starts when the holder acquired it. Two durations
measured from different events cannot be ordered by comparing their lengths,
so ordering them cannot prevent a late contender from stealing a live lock.

The accepted tradeoff refuses to write when a local holder appears alive, even
after long delay. The asymmetry is the whole argument: refusing to write is
recoverable; writing concurrently with a live holder is not — so every
uncertainty resolves toward waiting. PID reuse can make abandoned state appear
live, but that recoverable refusal is preferable to concurrent
read-truncate-write repair corrupting the journal. Do not reintroduce an
unconditional age ceiling as a convenience fix.

This is bounded record-store rationale, not distributed-lock doctrine. Foreign
or unreadable holders still use age fallback, and checking identity before
unlink detects many replacements but does not close the check/unlink race.
Owner-checked release helps prevent cascading theft without proving universal
exclusion.

**Bounded retry** (2026-09-05). Waiting is only safe if it ends. Every
iteration that fails to acquire falls through one deadline check and one
sleep, with no `continue` above them and no branch that retries for free: the
first version checked the deadline on one branch only, so an unreadable lock
or one that kept failing to be removed retried forever, hot. Retrying at once
after a reclaim saves about 25ms and reopens that hole. Two file shapes
reproduce the pathologies deterministically, where permission tricks do not:
a directory where the lock belongs (a non-ENOENT read error), and a dangling
symlink (the name exists, yet the lock reads as vanished on every pass).
