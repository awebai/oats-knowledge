title: Cache fetch negotiates before one whole-pack retry
description: A filtered cache keeps cheap negotiated fetches, then retries once without negotiation on an unknown failure because advertised commits can imply missing delta bases and negotiated non-thin HTTPS fetch was unavailable.

# Decision

The source records this choice on 2026-10-13: fetch a commit into the kernel's
remote cache with negotiation first; if the failure classifies as `unknown`,
make exactly one second attempt without negotiation. Report the second
attempt's own failure if it fails. Do not enable implicit missing-object
fetches to make either attempt succeed [1].

## The discovery behind the retry

Advertising a commit as a Git `have` does not prove that a filtered cache
holds every blob reachable from it. The source's investigation found that
the server could send a wanted blob as a delta against a larger version that
the cache's size filter had omitted. Completing that pack then required a
missing base; with lazy fetch forbidden, the fetch failed [1].

This needs no exotic repository: a file can cross the filter threshold as it
grows, shrinks or is split. Reading a head and then an older pin can expose
it. Moving the branch is not a reliable cure, and deleting the cache is not
a durable repair: the same head-then-pin sequence can recreate the state.
The conflict is between incremental negotiation's assumptions and the
intentional refusal of implicit fetch, not evidence of a broken network.
The security rationale for forbidding lazy fetch remains in
[the observation lesson](/nodes/oats-kernel-expert/lessons/observation-must-not-harm-the-observer.md);
this decision does not relax that boundary.

## Rejected alternatives and the cost accepted

- **Never negotiate.** The source reports this avoided the missing-base
  failure but made the common adjacent-head fetch much more expensive:
  about 5.88 MiB without negotiation versus 5.76 KiB with it. Across a
  measured sequence of 60 heads, the selected design transferred about
  7.7 MiB versus 301 MiB without negotiation. These are measurements of
  that experiment, not portable byte counts or a promised failure rate [1].
- **Keep negotiation but request a self-contained, non-thin pack.** This
  would remove the failed first attempt while preserving useful `have`
  information. The source checked Git 2.55: `git fetch` exposed no switch
  for it, while `git fetch-pack` without `--thin` supplied the needed pack
  but did not speak HTTPS. **Revisit this decision if the HTTPS-capable
  fetch path gains that control**; the workaround is not an intrinsic
  preference for failing first [1].
- **Retry only on a particular Git sentence.** The observed wording differed
  by transport and version. Use the failure classification, not a copied
  stderr phrase, to decide whether the single retry is allowed.

The failing case pays for one unsuccessful attempt and a whole pack. The
gate also makes classifier correctness part of recovery correctness: the
source found an object's hexadecimal id containing digits that matched an
`auth` status pattern, which would suppress the retry. Keep object ids out
of status-text matching; do not turn arbitrary object-id text into evidence
of authentication failure. The reason for preserving `unknown` is recorded
in [the CLI-boundary lesson](/nodes/oats-kernel-expert/lessons/machine-boundary-contract.md).

## Enforcement, not a permanent troubleshooting ritual

The elimination route is the kernel fetch policy and regression coverage:
a real filtered cache with a moved default branch and an older pin, transport
variants, a classifier case containing status-like object-id digits, and a
second failure that remains the final answer. The proposal reports regression
coverage in the implementation reference; this harvest did not execute it.
A future native non-thin fetch control is the architectural route to removing
the failed attempt. Temporary-file handling has its own
[age-bounded cleanup decision](/nodes/oats-kernel-expert/decisions/cache-fetch-cleanup-waits-out-possible-writers.md).
