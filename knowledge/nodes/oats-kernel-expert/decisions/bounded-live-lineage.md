# Rationale

Accepted 2026-07-26 by the founder, on top of the explicit-lineage decisions of
2026-07-25/26. Lineage answers how living instances relate now, not how every
historical task unfolded. Explicit sparse relations preserve that lightweight
purpose. Attached work already establishes ownership; contradictory relation
choices should not fabricate an independent work owner. Attached service
agents are children of the tree owner so retirement responsibility stays
local; a non-attached overseer expresses its topology explicitly. One
consequence (2026-07-26): a parent relation re-points only the anchor's
recorded lineage, so one spawn cannot become the parent of two existing
instances and there is no re-parent verb; bringing another party under an
overseer is an agreement between the parties, not a graph edit.

**Lineage is explicit-only.** Deriving a parent from ambient environment
("whoever's instance variable is set") was rejected even when gated on the
parent being alive, because a human terminal inside an agent's session window
*is* an alive instance — the misattribution case is the alive case. Only
explicit intent is safe. Cross-deployment spawns stay operator-origin: a parent
outside the target deployment would be a dangling edge that deployment's own
surfaces cannot resolve, so recording it would manufacture
misattribution-shaped metadata.

**Attribution wording refined, 2026-10-18:** the earlier operator-origin
statement does not make lineage an actor classifier. The maintainer's
[caller-attribution decision](caller-attribution-is-separate-from-lineage.md)
permits ambient same-deployment context for an informational label, accepting
the inherited-human-shell ambiguity because the label gates no authority.
The cross-deployment statement above still holds: foreign-deployment context
cannot establish instance-origin there. This changes the attribution
rationale, not the human-accepted explicit-only lineage rule above; the linked
decision is its canonical explanation.

Names are not globally unique. Refusing an ambiguous edge is preferable to
silently linking the wrong instance. The disambiguator is an operation-time
qualifier and is never persisted: stored edges stay bare names, which avoided
a lineage migration, and every copied edge must resolve identically from both
contexts that will read it. Desktop must preserve the same qualification rather
than invent certainty from a filtered roster.

Whoever writes cross-instance metadata owns its repair on both sides' lifecycle
events, across the whole scope where the reference can be created; a change to
relation policy migrates every agent-facing spawn recipe in the same change, or
live agents keep following the old topology.

The founder accepted two costs instead of introducing a journal or lease
service: concurrent parent spawns on one anchor can leave a last-writer result,
and retirement can partially splice the graph if a later write fails. Do not
present atomic file writes as multi-file serializability. Revisit this tradeoff
only with observed need for stronger coordination, not because a graph can
theoretically be made more elaborate.
