title: A partial catalog remains an answer in both CLI forms
description: Exposing catalog problems preserves successful partial-answer semantics across text and JSON, the established diagnostic stream, and the distinction between a problem and a missing item.

# Decision and rationale

A partially readable catalog can still provide a useful answer. Exposing
problems previously omitted from text output should preserve the successful
partial-answer semantics already shared with JSON: choosing a representation
does not change whether the same read counts as an answer. This is a bounded
catalog decision, not a rule that every failed read or diagnostic must exit
successfully.

The source reports agreement by both maintainer sides on 2026-10-13 to show
all catalog problems through the established text problem-row stream [1].
Sending newly visible problems to stderr was proposed to protect scripts
consuming text, then rejected because existing text diagnostics already
appeared under the table. Moving only the newly exposed problems would split
one diagnostic list across streams. A general stream migration requires a
separate coordinated compatibility decision; a visibility repair does not
authorize it.

A non-zero exit for a partial listing was rejected in the same decision [3].
It would make the text form disagree with the JSON answer of the same read,
and on a host that still carries the cache-fetch defect of awebai/oats#1059
it would fail the listing each time a pin moves.

**A diagnostic is not evidence that an item is absent.** The source's producer
inspection found problems attached to retained but invalid or non-spawnable
items, as well as missing informational metadata [2]. A nonempty problem list
therefore cannot support a blanket claim that the catalog listing is
incomplete. Display each diagnostic with its existing item context; base a
missing-item conclusion on evidence of omission, not the diagnostic count.

The durable decision is the compatibility rationale and the rejected stream
split. Exact fields, formatting and producer behavior remain authoritative
in repository code and documentation. This record does not claim that the
implementation has merged or shipped.

# Enforcement

Keep the rendering repair in the kernel and cover the same catalog evidence
in text and JSON regression cases: successful partial answers, all diagnostics
visible in the established channel, and retained-item problems that must not
produce an invented missing-item conclusion. Tests enforce the chosen
behavior; this decision preserves why changing representation or revealing
more diagnostics must not silently migrate the contract. No delivered test
coverage is asserted here.

3. Verified by the knowledge maintainer at review of the harvest on

   reports the soul listing in text form leaving out package souls it could
   not read, with a successful exit and no message, while the JSON form
   carries a problem for each. The kernel lead's proposal there sent the new
   rows to stderr to protect scripts that read the text form. The
   release-lane decision in comment 6150347222 keeps them in the place and
   form the command already uses for problem rows, for the soul and
   capability listings alike, keeps the successful exit because the JSON
   form already answers the same read as a success, and rejects both stderr
   and a non-zero exit with the reasons given above; a move of problem rows
   to stderr is named there as a question for every listing and the doctor
   at once. Comment 6150371757 agrees and withdraws stderr. The producer
   inspection is in
   [comment 6150603106](https://github.com/awebai/oats/issues/1098#issuecomment-6150603106),
   which the citations above do not name: it lists a name and directory
   mismatch, colliding package souls and member package-manifest problems
   as rows whose item stays in the listing, and comment 6150627062 agrees
   for that reason that no closing sentence calls the listing incomplete.
   The item context is bounded by the same comments: it is built only from
   fields a row already carries, it adds no JSON field and no second
   sentence, and comment 6150685531 withholds an external row's source
   reference until the repository has one function that prints such a
   reference. That items were non-spawnable and that some rows concern
   missing informational metadata appear in no comment and rest on the
   source's note alone, which this review did not read. The issue and the
   pull request that carries the fix were open and unmerged at review, and
   no release was checked. The comments are maintainer-lane records posted
   from the two maintainers' accounts, not evidence of human acceptance.
