title: Integrity, origin and consent are different proofs
description: Membership trusts member capabilities and declaring a package trusts it; the lock proves reproducible contained bytes, not approval; host-install consent is a separate, explicit step.

# Rationale

Each proof answers one question, and none implies another.

**Trust is membership or declaration.** A member capability is trusted by the
reciprocal membership handshake: whoever can push to the member decides what
runs, the same model every team already accepts for committed `.agents/skills/`.
A package comes from outside that boundary and is trusted by its declaration
in the workspace's `packages:` (human decision 2026-09-24, OATS 0.26.0). The
earlier per-version executable approval was removed because people declare a
package only when they trust it; a second approval stacked on that
declaration was ceremony, not a boundary
([workspace model v2](/nodes/oats-expert/decisions/workspace-model-v2.md)).
A spawn admits only a locked package the workspace *still* declares.

**Removed: configuration scope as the trust boundary.** From 2026-07-12 the
classic kernel trusted a capability authored at a configuration scope and
required a lock and integrity match for an acquired one, so location alone
could not confer trust. v2 removed scopes: location is never version, and a
directory's position confers nothing. What survived is the principle that
trust is decided at one explicit, reviewable place.

**Integrity is reproducibility, not approval.** The lock pins each package's
commit and content digest; a moved tag or drifted content is
`E_PACKAGE_INTEGRITY`, and at spawn the lock's capability list must match the
package at the locked commit. Drift is a refusal, never a diff: a command that
fell back to current source bytes when the locked ones changed would let
whoever edits the source present arbitrary bytes as "upstream". Advancing is
an explicit `oats sync` against a changed declaration.

**Origin needs its own check.** A digest can match while the artifact tells a
different origin story from the lock (2026-07-29), so provenance consistency
is checked beside content. Check order is not cosmetic: missing → drifted →
provenance, because reporting the wrong class sends the operator to the wrong
repair.

**A trust boundary must contain the actual runtime bytes.** Escaping manifest
paths, symlinks out of a fetched tree and resources borrowed from staging
undermine a boundary even when the manifest is hashed; v2 refuses symlinks
in fetched trees (except the soul's `CLAUDE.md` alias) and traversal in remote
tree names. Classify a value's policy class *before* normalization erases it.
A persisted field that is later re-parsed as input is itself a trust boundary:
validate it against the writer's exact grammar, and never let "absent"
collapse with "present but malformed". Argument vectors remove shell injection,
not option injection
([hook failures and error messages are output channels](../lessons/hook-and-error-channels-disclose.md)
owns that rule); in a lock system its consequence is a reference that silently
selects nothing and reports the wrong pin.

**Host-install consent is separate from declaring a package.** A capability's
`requires` names host commands and harness packages. OATS never installs
either silently: a harness package is verified at spawn in that harness's own
package list, never installed there, and a missing one fails the spawn with
the consent command that fixes it. It is raised only for deployments that use
that harness; installed is not enabled; identity ignores version selectors.
Verify through the exact executable and scope the session will use, preferring
the harness's machine output over its human rendering. None of these proofs
asserts that a *secret* is present: credential presence is a per-human runtime
fact, surfaced as an advisory warning or a first-use failure, never as
checked-in configuration.
