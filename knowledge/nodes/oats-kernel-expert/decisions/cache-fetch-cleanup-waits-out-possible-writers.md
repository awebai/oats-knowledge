title: Cache fetch cleanup waits out possible writers
description: Failed-fetch temporary files are reclaimed only after the longest fetch can have elapsed because a new write lock and a before-and-after listing cannot establish ownership against older lock-free Git writers.

# Decision

The source's 2026-10-13 review records a correction to failed-fetch cleanup:
leave fresh temporary files alone. A later fetch, under the cache write
lock, removes only temporary files older than the longest fetch. This is a
bounded-age policy for these fetch artifacts, not permission to delete
arbitrary caches or reclaim live-holder locks [1].

## Why immediate cleanup was rejected

Git chooses the temporary filename. A file that appeared during a failed
attempt is therefore not proven to belong to that attempt. Older kernels
can still fetch into the same cache without taking the new write lock;
serializing new writers does not serialize those old writers. The source
reports that a review probe's lock-free second writer lost its live pack to
the first version's immediate cleanup [1].

The tempting promise that a failed fetch leaves nothing behind was stronger
than the ownership evidence. A before-and-after directory comparison could
not make it true safely. The selected rule accepts temporary leftovers
rather than risk destroying another fetch's in-progress output. Its safety
argument depends on an actual bound on fetch lifetime: changes to that bound
or to which processes may write here must revisit the cleanup threshold,
not retain a magic age indefinitely.

## Deferred alternative and enforcement

A per-fetch quarantine would provide exact ownership and permit immediate
cleanup. The source records that alternative as deferred because it changes
the cache design, rather than as inherently undesirable. Reconsider it if
exact cleanup becomes necessary; do not approximate ownership from filename
appearance while retaining the shared directory.

The elimination route is ownership isolation or enforced lifetime-bounded
cleanup in the cache implementation, with a lock-free second-writer
regression alongside the new lock-respecting path. The proposal reports
that coverage; this harvest did not run it. This decision complements the
[negotiated fetch and single retry](/nodes/oats-kernel-expert/decisions/cache-fetch-negotiates-before-one-whole-retry.md),
whose unsuccessful first attempt makes correct cleanup important. It does
not replace the distinct [record-lock liveness policy](/nodes/oats-kernel-expert/decisions/record-lock-liveness-tradeoff.md).
