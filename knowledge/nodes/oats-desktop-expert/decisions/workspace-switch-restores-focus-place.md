# Restore the place that made the switch useful

The source expert's decision dated 2026-10-27 answers a request to type
immediately after returning to a workspace. Remember the window's last
focus place there **outside transit surfaces**: the workspace list and its
heading, palette, dialogs, menus and listboxes are routes through the UI,
not the work place to restore.

This fills the cross-workspace question deliberately left separate by
[editor-group ownership](editor-group-layout-ownership.md). It does not
change which group owns a tab, close succession, or the distinction between
activating a tab and asking to type in it.

Restore a terminal place to its input, ready to type. Restore a roster row
by instance identity after the arriving roster paints. Restore a tab or page
control by identity; if the control is unavailable, use its region's landing
rather than leaving focus on the document body. The landing must belong to
the rebuilt arriving view, not a view about to be replaced.

# Why the obvious alternatives were rejected

- **Always focus the active terminal:** that overrides a remembered roster
  or page-control place. The user's last working control, not merely the
  active tab, determines the destination.
- **Read the active element at departure:** the workspace-list row used to
  leave has already displaced the useful focus. Saving that row reproduces
  the failure instead of remembering the place before transit.
- **Add per-workspace page/stage memory:** the source rejects this as part
  of this change; remembering focus is not permission to redesign page
  restoration.
- **Carry focus in the take-over layout descriptor:** the source rejects
  expanding that hand-off contract for local focus restoration. Keep the
  supplied layout's active-terminal focus instead.

# Intent and explicit destinations take precedence

A switch and its deferred focus arrival share one intent ticket. A later
operator action supersedes it, including while roster or page rebuilding is
pending. This applies [keyboard intent](../lessons/keyboard-focus-and-action-ownership.md)
and [async ownership](../lessons/asynchronous-intent-and-truthful-outcomes.md):
returning to a workspace may restore input, but delayed completion must not
steal it from a newer action.

Three boundaries are deliberate:

- A workspace step initiated with focus in the workspace list keeps focus
  in that list, preserving the source-reported terminal-client parity.
- A switch made to reach its own destination, such as a Teams-board hand-off
  or followed view, is not followed by this competing restoration.
- A take-over bringing a layout retains that layout's focus behavior; it
  does not apply the window's remembered place over the supplied layout.

Protect these choices with arrival-path regressions covering the transit
control, missing identity, repaint ordering and a later user action during
an unfinished restore. Tests should enforce the behavior; this record
preserves why the destinations differ, not a second map of renderer helpers.

# Evidence and limits

Evidence: OKF proposal from oats-desktop-expert/workspace-switch-focus-expert, 2026-10-27; notes/workspace-switch-focus-place.md.

The source identifies [awebai/oats#1560](https://github.com/awebai/oats/pull/1560)
as the implementation proposal and the terminal client's
[Tabs contract](https://github.com/awebai/oats/blob/main/docs/tui.md#tabs)
as the list-focus precedent. At capture it reports developer review approval,
with maintainer review and live Electron evidence still pending. Those are
source-reported evidence limits, not shipment, human acceptance of every
exception, or live verification by this harvest. The decision record grants
no permission to run Desktop on the operator's machine.
