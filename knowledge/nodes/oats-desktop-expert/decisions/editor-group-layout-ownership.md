title: Editor groups own layout and close succession
description: Persistent groups preserve ordered work and focus better than temporary per-tab split slots or unrelated global recency.

# Rationale

Decided 2026-07-27 by the Desktop engineering role, on human feedback
about the first shipped split: a phantom empty chrome row under the tabs,
the split vanishing on tab switch, and new tabs not opening into the
current split. The fix was a model change, not a patch — splits became
editor groups with the semantics VS Code users already know.

The rejected split model (the per-tab "pending slot" arrangement of the
first shipped split, replaced by this decision) attached a temporary arrangement to a tab, so changing tabs could dissolve the layout. Persistent groups instead own ordered work and an active member. New work follows the focused group; the first split preserves existing current-workspace terminal tabs and intentionally focuses the new empty group.

Closing work should select a neighboring group member rather than an unrelated recent terminal. One real semantic tab control per item, with per-group navigation, avoids duplicated or phantom chrome and preserves accessibility.

Group ownership within a layout does not by itself decide restoration across workspace switches. Treat cross-workspace restoration as a separate product decision, and verify version-specific behavior in the maintained Desktop contract.
