title: Explain a technical model with an overview and a closed developer disclosure
description: Lead with one plain user-facing sentence and place developer-only mechanisms in a native disclosure, sharing state meanings with the visible rows rather than maintaining a second explanation.

# Decision

For a screen whose underlying model needs detail mainly for developers,
start with an **Overview** containing one plain sentence in user terms.
Place the mechanism, diagram and detailed state explanations in a native
`<details>` disclosure labelled **For developers**, closed by default.

The source reports product-owner approval on 2026-10-14 for this pattern in
Setup. Its overview identifies what the host repository defines—the
workspace, its members and its packages—without first teaching reciprocal
membership links. The links and the meanings of member states remain
available in the disclosure. This records how to explain that model, not a
second specification of workspace membership.

# Why this form was chosen

The product owner wanted an explanation of the host and its links, then
asked for it to be shorter and less technical. The earlier multi-paragraph
opening buried the useful summary under the mechanism. The screen serves
people running the workspace, not only those wiring repositories together.

The accepted tradeoff keeps the purpose immediately legible and puts the
mechanism one deliberate interaction away rather than deleting it. Native
disclosure semantics supply the keyboard and accessibility foundation
without introducing another custom interaction. That choice does not itself
prove the complete screen's accessibility: the existing
[quality and live-verification bar](design-direction-and-quality-bar.md)
still applies.

# One meaning for the explanation and the rows

Detailed state explanations and row labels draw from one shared source of
state meanings. Duplicating the vocabulary in explanatory copy would let
help text contradict the chips it is meant to explain. Keep the common
meaning in code; do not store a second table of current state words here.
Shared data and composition-level checks are the enforcement route for
agreement between the two surfaces.

This is progressive disclosure of developer detail, not permission to hide
operational warnings or the row's state. It also does not replace the
separate [shared-reader wording and attribution decision](shared-readers-separate-client-terms-and-kernel-prose.md),
which governs client terms and the speaker of transported prose.

# Tab concepts use an information modal

An additive product-owner choice reported on 2026-10-23 distinguishes a
newcomer's **definition of the tab's subject** from developer-only detail
about an operational screen. For Souls and Capabilities, a round **i** in
the tab toolbar opens a modal in the existing lifecycle-dialog frame, with
one **Close** button. Explain what a soul is, or what capabilities are,
their three sources and what Core and workspace defaults mean, as appropriate
to that tab.

An inline disclosure was considered and rejected for these definitions:
the product owner chose a modal. This does **not** supersede Setup's inline
overview and closed developer disclosure above. Do not turn either example
into a universal rule that every explanation must use its container. The
modal keeps introductory definitions on demand; the Setup pattern separates
a useful visible summary from developer mechanism.

[Workspace defaults](workspace-defaults-show-scope-and-purpose.md) records
the placement and purpose of that section, and
[Desktop composition vocabulary](desktop-copy-names-instances-and-injection.md)
keeps the explanation aligned with the inspection UI. Reusing the dialog
frame does not waive the existing accessibility and live-verification bar.

Evidence: OKF proposal from oats-desktop-expert/oats-desktop-expert-capabilities-workspace-defaults, 2026-10-23; notes/capabilities-defaults-design.md.

The source reports the product-owner's modal choice during the 2026-10-23
design rounds and identifies [awebai/oats#1489](https://github.com/awebai/oats/pull/1489).
Acceptance and implementation remain source-reported, not independently
audited by this harvest.

# Evidence

Evidence: OKF proposal from oats-desktop-expert/oats-desktop-expert-teams-design, 2026-10-15; notes/teams-setup-design-direction.md.

The proposal and note report product-owner acceptance on 2026-10-14 after
successive shorter, less technical mock revisions, and implementation in
[awebai/oats#1191](https://github.com/awebai/oats/pull/1191). The proposal also
reports the shared state vocabulary. Acceptance, shipment and that
implementation detail are source-reported; this harvest did not inspect
the code or reproduce the accessibility behavior.
