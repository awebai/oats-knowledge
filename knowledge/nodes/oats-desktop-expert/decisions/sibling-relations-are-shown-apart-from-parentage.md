title: Explicit sibling links are shown on both ends and apart from parentage
description: Show only direct explicit sibling links on both endpoints, using separate dotted sibling and solid lineage cues in the sidebar and palette with an accessible word-based reading so siblinghood cannot be mistaken for parentage.

# Decision and rationale

The source records a 2026-10-16 design decision: show a sibling relation
without inventing lineage or making the operator decipher a mark shared with
parentage. It reports a human-owner request, relayed by the lane maintainer,
to separate the sidebar's sibling and parent-child lines; the detailed design
was delegated to the Desktop expert and accepted through maintainer review
and merge. That is source-reported direction and delegated design acceptance,
not independently verified human approval of every detail.

# Explicit links, not inferred sibling sets

Show siblinghood only for the kernel's explicit `siblingInstance` link,
resolved by identity over the row's own deployment's full roster. Apply the
existing [identity and ambiguity rule](/nodes/oats-desktop-expert/lessons/identity-and-relationship-legibility.md)
before filtering; a narrower visible list must not manufacture an edge.
Show a resolved direct link on **both endpoints**, not only on the row that
stores the link. The operator should read the same relation from either end.

Reject two ways of claiming more than the kernel established:

- **Spawn-time `relation`/`relativeTo` as current relations.** Retirement can
  splice live lineage while the spawn record still names a retired instance.
  Historical spawning intent is not the current graph.
- **Transitive sibling closure.** C linked to B and B linked to A does not
  warrant showing C and A as siblings. Show each row's direct links, not a
  derived all-to-all family.

Co-children already read as peers through the same parent label and
indentation. Do not add a list of sibling names to every child: it states
parentage twice and grows to N−1 names per row. The explicit sibling cue
serves the root-to-root link that parentage does not express. This is a
Desktop reading of [bounded live lineage](/nodes/oats-kernel-expert/decisions/bounded-live-lineage.md),
not a change to the kernel's relationship or retirement policy.

# One relation, distinct visual and accessible readings

Keep siblings on the same column and indent children. The 2026-10-16 decision
used visible words and no connectors in the palette. That palette-only
restriction is **partially superseded (2026-10-19)**: the source reports the
human owner's request for the sidebar's tree and connectors in the palette.
The sidebar decision and the direct-link semantics above remain unchanged.

- **Sidebar:** the dotted sibling link joins the dots on their column; the
  solid parent-child lineage runs separately to its right. A shared column
  lets a solid line stand in for a dotted one and hides which relation is
  being shown. Separation is semantic, not merely a cosmetic offset.
- **Palette:** reuse the sidebar's connector builder and rules: a dotted
  sibling link on the dot column and solid lineage separately to its right.
  Keep the “under …” and “sibling of …” reading for assistive technology only,
  with each relation spoken once rather than repeated. The shared drawing
  keeps the palette a reading of the same tree, not a competing relationship
  language. Keep relation wording in one shared client home under the existing
  [shared-reader wording boundary](/nodes/oats-desktop-expert/decisions/shared-readers-separate-client-terms-and-kernel-prose.md),
  not a second general wording policy.

Once separated, the dotted sidebar line is the only sibling graphic on its
column. In the palette it is now the only **visible** sibling cue; an
assistive-technology-only phrase does not make the graphic redundant for
sighted users. Treat both as **meaningful**, meeting WCAG 1.4.11's 3:1 contrast
against every effective fill they cross, including the palette surface and
selection fill in every theme. The solid lineage can remain decorative
**because indentation independently conveys parentage**. Decorative status
follows redundant meaning, not the fact that something is drawn as a line.
A future redesign that removes the redundant cue must revisit that judgment.

Apply the [effective-colour inventory](/nodes/oats-desktop-expert/lessons/effective-contrast-over-token-pairs.md)
rather than treating a token-pair check as proof. Pixel offsets, stroke
construction and colour constants belong in the repository. Shared-reader
regressions should preserve direct-link symmetry and ambiguity refusal;
rendering/accessibility checks should preserve distinct cues, one spoken
relation and contrast on every effective fill. Those checks enforce the
choice; this record preserves why it was chosen, without claiming they were
run by the harvest.

This adds concrete sibling-display rationale to the existing no-colour-only
rule. It does not supersede [name-ordered roster recognition](/nodes/oats-desktop-expert/decisions/roster-name-order-preserves-recognition.md)
or [the palette's subtree-recency ordering](agent-centered-navigation.md#recency-belongs-in-the-instance-palette-not-the-roster).

# Evidence and limits

Evidence: OKF proposal from oats-desktop-expert/oats-desktop-expert-palette-siblings, 2026-10-16; notes/palette-sibling-design.md; notes/sidebar-sibling-line-own-column.md.

The source identifies [awebai/oats#1312](https://github.com/awebai/oats/issues/1312)
and comment 6214880493 for the design, [PR #1313](https://github.com/awebai/oats/pull/1313)
(`a01d723d`) for the palette and [PR #1316](https://github.com/awebai/oats/pull/1316)
(`b591ff93`) for the sidebar. Request, acceptance and merge references remain
source-reported. The sidebar note reports static-page checks with real CSS,
not Electron; this harvest did not audit those changes or establish live
assistive-technology behavior.

Evidence: OKF proposal from oats-desktop-expert/oats-desktop-expert-palette-order, 2026-10-19; notes/palette-recency-tree-design.md.

The partial supersession's source identifies [awebai/oats#1383](https://github.com/awebai/oats/issues/1383)
for design and [PR #1385](https://github.com/awebai/oats/pull/1385) for implementation.
It reports the human-owner request on 2026-10-19, effective-colour contrast
checks by developer and reviewer, and visual placement checked on a static
page with real CSS. These are source-reported evidence, not this harvest's
measurements; no Electron or assistive-technology run is claimed.

Maintainer check (2026-10-19, review of oats-knowledge#133): awebai/oats#1383
records the owner's request for the sidebar's connectors in the palette, and
PR #1385, merged 2026-10-19, names the palette half of #1312 as superseded. The
human-requested part of the 2026-10-16 decision, the sidebar's separate lines,
is unchanged; the palette's no-connector reading was delegated design.
