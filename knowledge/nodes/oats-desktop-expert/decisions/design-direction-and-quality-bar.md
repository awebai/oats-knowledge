title: One design authority, a stated quality bar, and a native terminal
description: The Desktop expert owns UX and design direction and the developer implements it; the quality bar is calm, coherent and accessible; a visual redesign never restyles the native terminal surface.

# Rationale

**One design authority** (human direction, 2026-09-29). Desktop has two
roles: `oats-desktop-expert` owns product rationale *and* UX and design
direction (information architecture, interaction design, visual language,
themes, accessibility, experience coherence), and `oats-desktop-developer`
builds all of `packages/desktop`, renderer views, styles, themes and copy
included, proposing design changes rather than drifting on them. A separate
designer soul was removed. It had its own authority over the renderer while
the expert held the interaction rationale and the developer held the rest of
the package, so a UI change crossed three roles, and the designer carried
the expert's skills unchanged. Rejected: keeping a designer that also
implements renderer work (it splits one package's code between two builders
and one design question between two authorities); a designer that only
advises (a third voice with nothing to own).

**Design direction.** Agents and their relationships stay at the centre of
the product ([Agent-centered navigation](agent-centered-navigation.md)), and
the product optimizes for situational awareness across large, active teams.
Before an unfamiliar flow changes, it is researched and specified; an
established design decision is changed only after reading why it was made.

**Quality bar.** Professional, calm, coherent and efficient. Clear hierarchy
and predictable interaction beat decoration. WCAG AA holds in every supported
theme, proven on effective colours
([Accessibility is proven on effective colours](../lessons/effective-contrast-over-token-pairs.md)),
and important flows are verified live, not only in the DOM.

# A redesign does not restyle the native terminal

A design-parity pass (Redesign v3, 2026-09-24) gave terminal tabs a
"transcript rhythm": 12px type, a 1.7 line height and a vertical inset. On
the real agent terminal it read as wrong: spaced-out rows between tool calls,
smaller text, and xterm's block cursor stretched to 1.7 rows, because the
cursor fills the whole cell. The human reverted it on 2026-09-29 to the
geometry chosen on 2026-07-23: 13px system monospace, xterm's default line
height, 32px side gutters and no vertical inset. tmux owns row spacing. The
terminal is the agent's own native surface
([Terminal tabs are viewers](terminal-viewers-not-session-owners.md)), so
design tokens may theme its colours but not its cell geometry. A mockup's
typography for a terminal region is not a spec for the live terminal. Test
it against a real TUI (box drawing, the cursor at an input line) before
adopting it.

# Font-size refinement, 2026-10-27

The [per-face terminal-size decision](terminal-size-belongs-to-its-face.md)
explicitly replaces the font/size-default part of the historical 13px system
monospace choice above: size choices and defaults follow the selected face,
not the host. The original decision remains visible as history. Its rejection
of mockup-driven row spacing, cursor distortion and vertical insets is not
superseded, nor is the native-fidelity quality bar. The new decision records
the source-reported visual acceptance and the human-review boundary for this
refinement of an earlier human-accepted rule.

# Related calibration

The [per-theme stroke-weight decision](per-theme-terminal-stroke-weight.md)
records a later native-fidelity calibration that leaves cell geometry intact;
it does not supersede the geometry rule above.

# Applications of the quality bar

The source-reported product-owner choices from the 2026-10-14 Teams and
Setup review apply this direction without superseding it:

- [Team instance scope](team-instance-lists-state-their-observation-scope.md):
  a partial view names whose instances and which machines it covers.
- [Chrome typography](chrome-typography-follows-information-role.md):
  names and secondary machine strings have distinct roles; terminal styling
  stays outside this hierarchy.
- [Overview and developer disclosure](technical-models-use-overview-and-developer-disclosure.md):
  purpose comes before mechanism, with technical detail available on demand.
