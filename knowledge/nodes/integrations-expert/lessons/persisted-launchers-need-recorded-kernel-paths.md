title: Persisted launchers need recorded kernel paths, not the installer's PATH
description: Record and verify absolute CLI and Node paths for commands an integration leaves behind, reject instance shims, and detect paths lost to upgrades rather than promising that absolute means permanent.

# The failure outlives the successful setup

A launcher, hook, menu action or bar widget can work during setup yet fail
when the desktop invokes it later. The source found two lifetime boundaries:
inside an OATS instance, `oats` on PATH selected that home's disposable shim;
in the desktop launch environment, Node supplied by the interactive shell's
version manager was not necessarily available. Retirement removes the first
locator, and leaving the shell removes the second assumption.

The [ambient-environment lesson](/nodes/integrations-expert/lessons/a-lifecycle-hook-never-trusts-the-ambient-environment.md)
owns which inputs a hook may trust for its current operation. This lesson
owns a different boundary: executable references the integration persists
for future invocations. Successful discovery in the installing process is
not evidence of the reference's lifetime or its usability by that consumer.

# Record a verified executable pair

Persist the absolute CLI entry point and Node executable, not a bare `oats`
command to be resolved again by the future process. Under kernel dispatch,
the selected command environment supplies `OATS_CLI_BIN` and `OATS_NODE_BIN`;
use those kernel-provided values, not a similarly named inherited assumption.
The kernel's current path contract belongs in
[capabilities.md](https://github.com/awebai/oats/blob/main/docs/capabilities.md),
including its guidance on the Node path a hook writes down.

Moving the integration to a standalone desktop plugin removes that dispatch
environment. The source's replacement design treats PATH as a discovery
input only: locate the installed CLI, refuse an instance-home `.oats/bin`
shim, resolve version-manager indirection, and verify the chosen pair with
`<node> <cli> version --json` before recording it. Merely taking a shim's
realpath can find the manager rather than the CLI; the reported mise case
needed `mise which oats` [1]. Preserve this distinction rather than treating
PATH discovery itself as forbidden when no kernel payload is available.

Use the kernel's stable-Node selection rule instead of inventing another
one. But **absolute is not permanent, and the rule is not a guarantee that
every installation yields an upgrade-stable path**. The earlier capability-era
note described the supplied Node path as surviving upgrades. The later
proposal narrows that claim: its actual selection still returned a versioned
mise path. A recorded version-specific executable can disappear when that
version is removed.

Consequently the persisted pair needs an explicit maintenance check. The
reported plugin design has a host post-update hook run `--check`, reporting
each recorded CLI or Node path that is gone. Do not hide that failure by
silently resolving a different executable from the launcher's ambient PATH.
Test the generated invocation under the intended minimal desktop environment,
not just the developer's shell. Existence and a version probe are bounded
checks, not proof of every command's future behavior.

# Enforcement and evidence limits

The elimination route is one resolver/recorder used by every generated
invocation, with regression cases for an instance shim, manager indirection,
minimal launch environment and removal of either recorded executable. The
post-update check covers lifetime loss that an install-time probe cannot
prevent. The knowledge worth retaining is why PATH persistence and an
unqualified stable-path promise were rejected; executable selection rules
and their tests remain code, not a second algorithm maintained here.

Evidence: OKF proposal from integrations-expert/integrations-expert-omarchy, 2026-10-19; notes/resolve-oats-from-the-kernel-not-path.md; notes/omarchy-plugin-facts-that-shape-a-setup.md.

1. The proposal identifies awebai/oats-omarchy #3 for the capability-era path
   choice and #5 for the plugin-era resolver and checks. It reports reusing
   the stable-Node rule from OATS v0.60.0. Resolution behavior and upgrade
   limitations are source-reported, not independently reproduced by this
   harvest; no live desktop apply or post-upgrade run is certified here.
