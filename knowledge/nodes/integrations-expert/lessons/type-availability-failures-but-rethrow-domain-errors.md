title: Type availability failures for the operator, but rethrow domain errors untouched
description: When a knowledge or messaging provider wraps remote operations to produce typed, operator-friendly availability errors, the wrapper must catch only transport and unusable-source failures and let custody, confirmation, path and validation errors pass through with their original codes.

Learned 2026-09-24 while giving a knowledge provider typed errors for an
unreachable, missing or shallow Git base, promoted from a developer
instance's harvest that was not allowed to ride its feature branch.

# Rule

A wrapper that turns clone, fetch, object-read and transport failures into
one typed availability error (with a reason such as timeout, auth, not-found
or shallow) must be narrow. Errors the provider already types for a
different reason, such as an owner or custody mismatch, a missing
confirmation, an escaping path, a base-selection error or a validation
failure, are rethrown as they are. The broad catch that made the first draft
simple also converted a custody mismatch into "base unavailable", which sent
the operator to the network when the real fault was authority.

The pattern that held:

- preflight locally configured sources before any clone, so a missing
  directory or a shallow clone is reported fast and without a network call;
- wrap only the operations that can fail for availability reasons, and only
  with the availability type;
- rethrow every domain error by code, and keep a test per domain code that
  asserts the code survives the wrapper.

# Why

Typed availability errors exist so readiness and setup can print one exact
remedy. A wrapper that absorbs domain errors defeats that purpose twice: the
remedy is wrong, and the provider's own qualification semantics (what counts
as an authority failure versus a transport failure) silently change under a
feature that was meant to be additive.

See also [integration guidance names only verbs the target CLI exposes](/nodes/integrations-expert/lessons/guidance-names-only-verbs-the-target-cli-exposes.md)
for the companion rule that readiness must report what the hook will do.
