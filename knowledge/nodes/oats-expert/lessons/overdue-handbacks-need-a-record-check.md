title: An overdue handback needs a record check, not indefinite mail waiting

# A chain of mail waits has no inherent checkpoint

A lead can wait for a developer's handback while the developer waits for a
reviewer. Neither receives a new result that prompts a look at the chain.
Silence alone cannot distinguish work still progressing, a blocker, a
missed handoff or a child with nothing else assigned. In the reported case,
the human noticed the delay before the lead did.

When delegating a step, record when its next result is expected. If that
checkpoint passes, inspect the records you are authorized to read before
asking for status: the branch head and its time, review artifacts, explicit
work-state or log entries, and lifecycle status. Use those observations to
find the unresolved dependency; when the child is waiting on mail you sent,
one such dependency is
[an undelivered wake](/nodes/oats-desktop-expert/lessons/idle-child-may-be-an-undelivered-wake.md),
which that lesson owns. Then unblock it within your authority, ask
one precise question whose answer changes the next action, or assign a
ready independent piece when the child's availability is established.

The overdue checkpoint is a reason to inspect, not proof of failure or
permission to interrupt a working reviewer. A stale commit, terminal silence
or a running process does not establish idleness; preserve the distinction
in [producer-reported activity](/nodes/oats-maintainer/decisions/instance-activity-is-reported-not-inferred.md).
Do not infer completion, bypass review, or mark unknown activity idle.
Nor does this lesson grant access to another instance's private records or
transcript: use only the shared or otherwise authorized evidence available
to the lead. It is not a polling loop or a demand for progress messages.

# Prevention and the existing communication rule

The existing `oats-token-saving` skill already says to read a shared record
instead of asking for progress. The additional lesson is **when to look**:
a result-only handoff needs an expected checkpoint so nested waiting does
not become invisible. Keep result and blocking-question messages; do not
replace them with periodic status reports.

Put checkpoint ownership and overdue-step handling into the existing lead
delegation guidance for separate review. Where the task system can expose
owned dependencies and overdue checkpoints, prefer that visibility to
repeated manual inspection. This is coordination debt, not a reason to add
a second activity detector or a new kernel lifecycle policy. No scheduler,
notification mechanism or skill change is claimed implemented here.

# Evidence and limits

Evidence: OKF proposal from oats-expert/app-owned-reader-expert,
2026-10-29; notes/check-children-instead-of-waiting-for-mail.md.

The source reports a second review round left uninspected for roughly an
hour and a half until the human asked. Inspection found the reviewer still
working, and an approval arrived shortly afterward. Thus the evidence is a
lead's visibility and scheduling miss, **not a demonstrated stuck reviewer**
or a measured review-time saving. The source subsequently separated
measurement from the code handback and started another ready piece; these
are examples of parallelizing work, not permission to skip verification or
a universal rule for stacking branches. Exact clock times and temporary PR
letters are not needed to preserve the lesson. No other instance's records
were read to verify the account during this harvest.
