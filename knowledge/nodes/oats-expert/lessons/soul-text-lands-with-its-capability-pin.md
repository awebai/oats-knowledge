title: Plan dependent soul text to land with or after its capability pin
description: When soul text relies on a package capability change, record the pin dependency in the plan and soul PR rather than treating two text changes as independent landings.

# Two text PRs can be one semantic change

A generic capability change and a soul-specific change can look independent:
each diff is coherent in its own repository. But the soul composes the
workspace's pinned package, not the capability repository's latest text. If
the soul starts relying on the new rule before the pin moves, a fresh
instance can receive contradictory instructions even though both PRs pass
their separate checks.

The planning mistake is to treat text-only work as release-independent.
When splitting a rule between a package capability and a soul that composes
it, identify which version makes the new soul text coherent. Plan the soul
PR to land **with or after the pin of that release**, and put that condition
in the soul PR description before handover. Merging the capability's source
alone does not satisfy it. This is a dependency to make visible to the
maintainer, not authority for the expert to choose release order or tag.

This applies when the soul actually depends on the new capability text; it
does not serialize unrelated wording changes. In the reported incident,
review caught a contradiction between the new soul's joining rule and the
older pinned capability before either PR merged. The possible bad spawn is
the reason for the ordering, not an observed shipped failure.

# Canonical boundaries and prevention

The accepted [source → tag → pin judgment](/nodes/oats-maintainer/stewardship/release-traps.md#source--tag--pin-proven-from-both-sides)
and the integration owner's [mirror-and-pin lesson](/nodes/integrations-expert/lessons/a-provider-release-is-mirrored-and-pinned-in-one-pr.md)
own release mechanics. This lesson adds the generalist's earlier planning
check for a semantic consumer: the soul's instructions. It complements
[tracing promised outcomes to their producer](/nodes/oats-expert/lessons/trace-done-items-to-owning-code-before-accepting-repo-list.md),
rather than duplicating package release procedure.

Prefer keeping a shared rule in one capability-owned home instead of two
independently changing definitions. Where the soul must specialize it,
review the **composed text at the intended pin**, not merely both diffs.
Structural composition tests and an enforceable PR dependency can prevent
known mismatches; a pin/parity check alone cannot establish that two pieces
of prose agree. The owning planning guidance should require the dependency
and landing condition. These are prevention routes, not claims that new
checks or skill changes have landed.

# Evidence and limits

Evidence: OKF proposal from oats-expert/oats-expert-maintainer-lanes,
2026-10-27; notes/soul-text-lands-after-the-capability-pin.md.

The source reports one planning miss found by an adversarial reviewer on
2026-10-26, involving [awebai/oats-engineering#16](https://github.com/awebai/oats-engineering/pull/16)
and [awebai/oats#1537](https://github.com/awebai/oats/pull/1537). At that
observation, neither PR had merged. This harvest did not audit those PRs,
compose a fresh instance or reproduce the contradiction; it preserves the
reported review lesson, not current PR, pin or release status.
